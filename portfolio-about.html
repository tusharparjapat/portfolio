        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Tusahr Mundhaliya, a passionate web developer with a knack for creating user-friendly websites.</p>
      
        <h3>My Story</h3>
        <p>I started my journey in web development when... Back in 11th grade, I had one thing clear in my mind: I wanted to become a software engineer. I liked the idea of building things with code, and the whole tech world fascinated me. As I learned more, I started experimenting with websites—first just messing around, then building actual projects, like this Netflix-style site that I thought looked pretty cool. Now, I’m working on a portfolio website for college, showcasing my skills and projects, and even thinking about freelancing to make websites for other people. It’s been a journey, but every project, every bit of progress, just pushes me closer to that dream of becoming a software engineer.</p>
      
        <h3>Skills and Expertise</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
          <li>Responsive Design</li>
          <li>React, Node.js</li>
          
          <!-- Add more skills as needed -->
        </ul>
      
        <h3>Outside of Work</h3>
        <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy hiking, exploring new technologies, and spending time with friends and family.</p>
      
        <h3>Future Goals</h3>
        <p>I'm excited to continue honing my skills in web development and work on innovative projects that make a positive impact.</p>
